Modern radiation science builds on Curie’s foundational work.
Today, radiation is used not just in medicine but also in energy, space exploration, and agriculture.
Techniques like PET scans and CT imaging rely on radioactive tracers.
Radiation is also used to sterilize medical equipment and food products.
In cancer therapy, radiation is finely targeted with computer-assisted precision.
Curie’s discoveries helped usher in the nuclear age and atomic research.
Safety protocols now ensure minimal risk during radiation exposure.
The principles of radiation detection and shielding stem from early Curie experiments.
Nuclear power plants use radioactive decay for energy generation.
Radiation science remains a critical part of modern technology and healthcare.
