The use of radium in treating cancer marked the birth of radiotherapy.
Marie Curie’s discoveries showed that radioactive materials could target and kill cancerous tissue.
Radiotherapy became a foundation for oncology in the early 20th century.
Hospitals began to build specialized facilities to offer radiation treatments.
Curie emphasized the importance of clinical safety and scientific precision.
Her research teams developed methods to control and direct radioactive emissions.
The first radiation treatments were crude but paved the way for modern protocols.
The Curie Institute in Paris became a center for cancer research and treatment.
Radiotherapy helped treat tumors previously thought inoperable.
Marie Curie’s pioneering work continues to influence cancer treatment to this day.
