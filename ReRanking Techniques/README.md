# ReRanking Techniques

Advanced reranking methods to improve retrieval quality and relevance in RAG systems by post-processing initial search results. Reranking is crucial for enhancing the precision of retrieved documents and ensuring the most relevant context reaches the LLM.

## What is Reranking?

Reranking is a two-stage retrieval process where an initial broad retrieval is followed by a more sophisticated ranking mechanism. This approach allows for fast initial retrieval followed by accurate relevance scoring.

## Reranking Pipeline Flow

```
Query → Initial Retrieval → Candidate Documents → Reranking Model → Final Ranked Results
  ↓           ↓                    ↓                   ↓              ↓
User Input → Vector Search → Top-K Documents → Relevance Scoring → Best Matches
```

## Why Reranking Matters

1. **Improved Precision**: Better relevance scoring than simple cosine similarity
2. **Context Quality**: Ensures most relevant documents reach the LLM
3. **Cost Efficiency**: Reduces token usage by providing better context
4. **Performance**: Faster than using complex models for initial retrieval
