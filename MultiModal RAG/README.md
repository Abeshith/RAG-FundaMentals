# MultiModal RAG

Advanced multimodal retrieval systems that process and understand multiple data types including text, images, charts, and diagrams within a unified RAG framework. This approach enables comprehensive document analysis where both textual and visual content contribute to generating accurate responses.

## What is MultiModal RAG?

MultiModal RAG extends traditional RAG systems by incorporating multiple data modalities into a single retrieval and generation pipeline. Instead of processing only text, it can simultaneously understand and retrieve information from text, images, charts, diagrams, and other visual elements, making it particularly powerful for complex document analysis.

## MultiModal RAG Pipeline Flow

```
Query → MultiModal Embedding → Cross-Modal Retrieval → Context Assembly → LLM Generation → Response
  ↓            ↓                      ↓                    ↓              ↓              ↓
User Input → Text/Image Vectors → Relevant Text+Images → Unified Context → Visual+Text → Final Answer
```

## Key Components

### 1. Multimodal Embeddings
- **CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training)**: Used for creating unified embeddings for both text and images
- **Text Embeddings**: Convert textual content into vector representations
- **Image Embeddings**: Transform visual content into the same embedding space as text
- **Cross-Modal Alignment**: Ensures text and images are represented in a shared semantic space

### 2. Document Processing Pipeline
- **PDF Extraction**: Extracts both text content and embedded images from PDF documents
- **Text Chunking**: Divides large text sections into manageable chunks for better retrieval
- **Image Processing**: Extracts, processes, and indexes visual elements from documents
- **Metadata Preservation**: Maintains information about page numbers, content types, and relationships

### 3. Vector Storage and Retrieval
- **FAISS Integration**: Efficient similarity search across multimodal embeddings
- **Unified Index**: Single index containing both text and image embeddings
- **Similarity Search**: Retrieves relevant content regardless of modality based on query semantics

### 4. Query Processing
- **Query Embedding**: Converts user queries into the same embedding space
- **Cross-Modal Retrieval**: Can retrieve both text and images relevant to the query
- **Context Assembly**: Combines retrieved text and visual elements for comprehensive context

## Implementation Features

### Notebook Contents (`MultiModal_RAG(IMG+TexT).ipynb`)

The implementation demonstrates a complete multimodal RAG pipeline with the following capabilities:

#### Document Processing
- Processes PDF documents containing both text and images
- Extracts text content and preserves formatting information
- Identifies and extracts embedded images from PDF pages
- Creates structured document chunks with appropriate metadata

#### Embedding Generation
- **Text Embedding Function**: Processes textual content using CLIP's text encoder
- **Image Embedding Function**: Processes visual content using CLIP's vision encoder
- **Unified Representation**: Both modalities are embedded in the same semantic space
- **Normalization**: Embeddings are normalized for consistent similarity calculations

#### Vector Database Creation
- Builds a unified FAISS index containing both text and image embeddings
- Maintains document metadata for tracking content types and sources
- Enables efficient similarity search across the entire multimodal corpus

#### Retrieval and Generation
- **Query Processing**: Embeds user queries using the same CLIP model
- **Multimodal Retrieval**: Retrieves relevant text chunks and images based on semantic similarity
- **Context Assembly**: Combines retrieved content into a comprehensive context
- **LLM Integration**: Uses Groq's LLaMA model for generating responses based on multimodal context
