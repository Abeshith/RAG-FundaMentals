Marie Curie, born in 1867 in Warsaw, Poland, was a pioneering physicist and chemist. 
She moved to Paris to study at the Sorbonne and met her husband, Pierre Curie, there. 
Together, they conducted groundbreaking research on radioactivity. 
Marie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and the only person to win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields.
Her dedication to science paved the way for women in STEM. 
She named the element polonium after her homeland. 
Her early education took place under oppressive Russian rule, which suppressed Polish culture. 
Curie excelled in her studies despite poverty and adversity.
She later founded the Radium Institute in Paris. 
Marie Curie died in 1934 from aplastic anemia, likely caused by prolonged radiation exposure.
