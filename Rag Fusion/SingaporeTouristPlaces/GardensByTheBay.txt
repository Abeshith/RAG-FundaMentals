Gardens by the Bay is a 101-hectare nature park in Singapore’s Marina Bay, embodying the city’s “City in a Garden” vision. It features three waterfront gardens: Bay South, Bay East, and Bay Central. The iconic Supertree Grove, with towering tree-like structures, hosts the Garden Rhapsody light and sound show nightly. The Flower Dome, the world’s largest glass greenhouse, showcases Mediterranean and semi-arid plants. The Cloud Forest houses a 35-meter-tall indoor waterfall and a misty rainforest environment. Visitors can stroll the Skyway for panoramic views or explore the conservatories for a climate-controlled experience. The park promotes environmental sustainability through its solar-powered Supertrees. It’s ideal for families, couples, and nature lovers seeking serene yet futuristic landscapes. The outdoor gardens are free to explore, while conservatories require tickets. The park is accessible via MRT (Bayfront station) or bus. Evening visits are recommended for cooler weather and light shows. The Children’s Garden offers interactive play areas for kids. Guided tours provide deeper insights into the park’s eco-friendly design. The park also hosts seasonal events and floral exhibitions.
