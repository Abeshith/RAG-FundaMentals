Marie and Pierre Curie's experiments led to the discovery of two new elements: polonium and radium. 
They identified that certain materials emitted a new kind of energy, which they called radioactivity. 
Their work built on Henri Becquerel's discovery of spontaneous radiation from uranium. 
Curie used painstaking methods to isolate radioactive isotopes from tons of pitchblende.
They discovered that radioactivity was a property of atoms themselves, not a chemical reaction.
This fundamentally changed the understanding of matter and atomic structure.
Their discoveries laid the foundation for nuclear physics and modern atomic theory.
Radium, in particular, emitted powerful radiation, which intrigued scientists globally.
Their work marked the beginning of a new era in physical science.
Marie Curie coined the term "radioactivity" to describe this phenomenon.
