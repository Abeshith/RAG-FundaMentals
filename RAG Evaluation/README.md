# RAG Evaluation

## Why Evaluate RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems combine information retrieval with language generation to answer questions using external knowledge. Evaluation is crucial to:
- Ensure the system retrieves the most relevant and accurate information.
- Measure the quality and reliability of generated answers.
- Detect and minimize hallucinations (answers not grounded in retrieved context).
- Identify areas for improvement in both retrieval and generation components.

Without systematic evaluation, it is difficult to trust or improve a RAG pipeline, especially for real-world or production use cases.

## RAGAS Evaluation Technique

RAGAS (Retrieval-Augmented Generation Assessment Suite) is a framework for evaluating RAG systems using a set of targeted metrics. It provides a comprehensive assessment by analyzing both the retrieval and generation stages. The main RAGAS metrics are:

- **Context Precision**: The fraction of retrieved context that is actually relevant to the question. High precision means the system avoids including irrelevant or distracting information.
- **Context Recall**: The fraction of all relevant context that was successfully retrieved. High recall means the system finds most of the information needed to answer the question.
- **Faithfulness**: Indicates whether the generated answer is fully supported by the retrieved context. High faithfulness means the answer does not hallucinate or introduce unsupported facts.
- **Answer Relevance**: Measures how well the generated answer addresses the user's question, regardless of whether it is fully supported by the context.

These metrics help diagnose whether issues are due to poor retrieval, weak answer generation, or both.

## Notebook Workflow and Contents

The notebook in this folder demonstrates a full RAG evaluation workflow, including:

1. **RAG Pipeline Construction**: Building a RAG system that retrieves relevant documents and generates answers using a language model. This involves setting up a retriever (e.g., vector search) and connecting it to an LLM for answer generation.

2. **Question Generation**: Using an LLM to generate realistic questions based on the available content. This simulates user queries and ensures the evaluation is grounded in the actual knowledge base.

3. **Answer Generation**: For each question, the RAG system retrieves context and generates an answer using the LLM, leveraging both the retrieved information and the model's reasoning.

4. **Dataset Creation**: Compiling a dataset that includes questions, generated answers, and the supporting context. This dataset is used for systematic evaluation and can be reused for benchmarking.

5. **Retrieval and Evaluation**: For each question in the dataset, the system:
   - Retrieves context using the retriever.
   - Generates an answer using the LLM.
   - Evaluates the results using RAGAS metrics (context precision, context recall, faithfulness, and answer relevance).

6. **Analysis and Interpretation**: The notebook interprets the evaluation results, helping you understand where the RAG system performs well and where it needs improvement. For example, low context recall may indicate the retriever is missing key information, while low faithfulness may point to hallucinations in the generated answers.

## Practical Significance

By following this workflow, you can:
- Quantitatively assess the effectiveness of your RAG pipeline.
- Identify whether retrieval or generation is the main bottleneck.
- Make informed decisions about improving your retriever, LLM, or both.
- Build trust in your RAG system for real-world deployment.

This approach ensures that your RAG system is not only accurate and relevant but also reliable and robust for practical applications.
