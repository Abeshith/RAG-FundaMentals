Radiumâ€™s intense radioactivity quickly found practical uses in medicine and industry.
Doctors began using radium to treat cancer through early forms of radiotherapy.
Radium was also used in luminous paints for watch dials and aircraft instruments.
Its glow-in-the-dark property made it popular, despite the health risks.
Marie Curie strongly advocated for its use in medical treatment.
During WWI, she equipped mobile X-ray units using radium and trained medical staff.
These units helped diagnose injuries on battlefields, saving countless lives.
Radium was once marketed in consumer products, from toothpaste to water bottles.
The dangers of radium exposure were not fully understood at the time.
Public fascination with radium led to both scientific progress and tragic health consequences.
