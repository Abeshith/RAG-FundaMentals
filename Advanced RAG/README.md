# Advanced RAG Implementations

This folder contains advanced implementations of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that go beyond basic retrieval and generation.

## Contents

### 1. [Agentic_RAG.ipynb](./Agentic_RAG.ipynb)
This notebook implements an agentic RAG system that combines LLM agents with retrieval capabilities to create more intelligent and autonomous RAG workflows.

**Key Features:**
- **Query Rewriting**: Automatically improves unclear or ambiguous queries
- **Document Relevance Grading**: Evaluates retrieved documents for relevance
- **Decision-Making Graph**: Uses LangGraph to create a structured workflow with decision points
- **Self-Improvement**: Can rewrite queries when retrieved documents are deemed insufficient

**Use Cases:**
- Enhanced RAG systems that can determine when to search for more information
- Systems that need to make autonomous decisions about information sufficiency
- Scenarios requiring query reformulation to get better search results

### 2. [Corrective_RAG_(CRAG).ipynb](./Corrective_RAG_(CRAG).ipynb)
This notebook implements a corrective RAG system that can detect and fix problems in the retrieval process.

**Key Features:**
- **Document Relevance Grading**: Binary scoring system to evaluate document relevance
- **Web Search Fallback**: Automatically falls back to web search when local documents are insufficient
- **Query Transformation**: Rewrites queries to improve retrieval performance
- **Structured Workflow**: Uses LangGraph to create a systematic pipeline with correction mechanisms

**Use Cases:**
- RAG systems that need to handle out-of-corpus questions gracefully
- Applications where high precision is required in answers
- Systems that need to seamlessly combine local and web knowledge

### 3. [MultiModal_Agent_RAG.ipynb](./MultiModal_Agent_RAG.ipynb)
This notebook demonstrates a multimodal RAG system that can handle both text and image data from academic sources.

**Key Features:**
- **Academic Paper Retrieval**: Searches ArXiv papers for relevant information
- **Image Analysis**: Processes images with OCR and contextual understanding
- **Information Fusion**: Combines insights from text and images for comprehensive responses
- **Structured Citation**: Includes academic citation information in responses

**Use Cases:**
- Research assistance tools that need to work with academic papers
- Systems that need to understand both textual and visual information
- Applications requiring scholarly responses with proper citations

### 4. [RAG_Swarm_Agent.ipynb](./RAG_Swarm_Agent.ipynb)
This notebook implements a swarm-based RAG system that uses multiple specialized agents to handle domain-specific queries.

**Key Features:**
- **Domain-Specific Agents**: Includes medical, legal, and technical specialist agents
- **Smart Query Routing**: Automatically routes queries to the appropriate domain expert
- **Specialized Retrievers**: Each agent has its own optimized retriever for its domain
- **Flexible Workflow**: Seamlessly directs questions to the most qualified agent

**Use Cases:**
- Multi-domain question answering systems
- Applications that need to provide expert-level responses across different fields
- Systems that need to handle a wide range of specialized queries

## Getting Started

To run these notebooks, you'll need:
- Python 3.8+
- LangChain and LangGraph libraries
- Sentence transformers for embeddings
- Access to LLM APIs (Groq in these examples)
- Additional libraries like ChromaDB, EasyOCR (for multimodal), etc.

## Key Concepts

These advanced RAG implementations demonstrate several cutting-edge concepts:

1. **Decision-Making in RAG Pipelines**: Using LangGraph to create conditional workflows
2. **Self-Correction Mechanisms**: Implementing feedback loops for improved results
3. **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Orchestrating specialized agents for domain-specific expertise
4. **Multimodal Fusion**: Combining information from different modalities (text and images)
5. **Structured Workflows**: Creating complex RAG pipelines with clear decision points
