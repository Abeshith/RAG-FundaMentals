The medical applications of radioactivity began with radium-based cancer treatments.
Curie’s work inspired further research into targeted radiation therapies.
Doctors found that certain radioactive isotopes could shrink tumors or destroy cancer cells.
Medical imaging also benefited, especially through early X-ray and gamma ray diagnostics.
The use of radioisotopes helped monitor and treat metabolic diseases.
Curie’s contribution was vital in integrating science into medicine.
Her mobile X-ray vans in WWI are considered a revolutionary innovation.
Today, nuclear medicine relies on her foundational research.
She set a precedent for using scientific discovery to benefit humanity.
Curie's legacy lives on in hospitals and treatment centers worldwide.
