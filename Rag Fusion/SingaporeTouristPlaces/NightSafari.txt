Walking trails like the Fishing Cat Trail offer closer encounters. The park is ideal for families and adventure seekers. Its open-concept design ensures animals roam freely in naturalistic habitats. The tram tour lasts about 40 minutes, with commentary. Night shows feature animal behaviors and conservation messages. The park is accessible via bus from Ang Mo Kio MRT. Dining options include local hawker-style food. The experience is best after dark for optimal animal sightings. Tickets include tram rides, but walking trails enhance the visit.
