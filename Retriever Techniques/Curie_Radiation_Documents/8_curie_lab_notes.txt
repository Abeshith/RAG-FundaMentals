Marie Curie kept detailed lab notebooks, many of which remain radioactive to this day.
These notes documented the complex processes used to isolate radium and polonium.
Her scientific rigor and careful documentation helped future researchers build upon her work.
The notebooks are stored in lead-lined boxes for safety.
Visitors to view her original papers must wear protective gear.
Her handwriting reflects both clarity and intense focus.
The notes reveal the painstaking physical labor behind early radioactivity research.
Despite lacking modern lab tools, Curie achieved extraordinary accuracy.
The lab notebooks are historical artifacts and symbols of scientific perseverance.
They capture the daily challenges and triumphs of Curieâ€™s groundbreaking work.
